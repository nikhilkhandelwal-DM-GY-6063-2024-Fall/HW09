# Neon Mondrian - HW09A

## **Project Overview**
This project reimagines Piet Mondrian's iconic "Composition in Red, Yellow, Blue, and Black" using code to dynamically replace its colors. The application allows users to modify the red, yellow, and blue regions of the painting through sliders and color pickers, creating an interactive and personalized remix of the artwork.

---

## **Features**
- **Dynamic Color Replacement**: Replace the red, yellow, and blue areas of the painting with custom colors.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust the similarity threshold for detecting each target color.
- **Color Pickers**: Choose new colors for the regions dynamically.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Display the original and modified images for easy comparison.

## **How It Works**
1. **Color Detection**:
   - The program identifies red, yellow, and blue pixels by comparing their RGB values to predefined target colors.
   - A similarity threshold determines how "close" a pixel's color needs to be to match the target.

2. **Color Replacement**:
   - Detected colors are replaced with user-selected colors from the color pickers.

3. **Interactivity**:
   - Sliders allow fine-tuning of the similarity thresholds, enabling precise control over color detection.
   - Color pickers enable dynamic selection of replacement colors.

## **Controls**
### **Sliders**:
- Adjust the sensitivity for detecting each target color:
  - **Blue Threshold**: Adjusts how similar a pixel must be to the original blue color.
  - **Red Threshold**: Adjusts how similar a pixel must be to the original red color.
  - **Yellow Threshold**: Adjusts how similar a pixel must be to the original yellow color.

### **Color Pickers**:
- Select the replacement color for each region:
  - **Blue Replacement**: Choose a new color for blue areas.
  - **Red Replacement**: Choose a new color for red areas.
  - **Yellow Replacement**: Choose a new color for yellow areas.

## **Design Process**
1. **Objective**: To create an interactive, user-friendly experience for remixing Mondrian's work.
2. **Steps**:
   - Implemented pixel manipulation using `loadPixels()` and `updatePixels()`.
   - Created a similarity function to detect colors with an adjustable threshold.
   - Integrated sliders and color pickers for customization.
   - Added side-by-side display for comparing the original and modified images.
3. **Challenges**:
   - Balancing color detection sensitivity to ensure accurate results without over-detection.
   - Positioning UI elements for accessibility and clarity.

## **Potential Enhancements**
- Add transparency and a background collage for more creative effects.
- Modify black and white areas to incorporate patterns or textures.
- Include additional interaction features, such as:
  - Reset button to revert changes.
  - Save button to download the modified artwork.
